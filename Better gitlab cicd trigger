Yes, you can absolutely simplify your GitLab CI/CD configuration by creating **common job templates** for tasks like Maven and Kaniko builds, and then using a simple **environment variable** like `SERVICE_NAME` to differentiate between microservices. This approach reduces redundancy even further by allowing you to pass the `SERVICE_NAME` as a variable, which can dynamically adjust the behavior for each microservice.

### Here's how you can set this up:

### 1. **Parent Pipeline (`.gitlab-ci.yml`)**

In the parent pipeline, define common job templates and use the `SERVICE_NAME` variable to determine which microservice is being built.

```yaml
stages:
  - validate
  - build_microservices

# Common Maven build job template
.maven_template:
  stage: build
  image: maven:3.8.4-jdk-11
  script:
    - echo "Building $SERVICE_NAME with Maven"
    - mvn clean install -DskipTests
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - "$CI_PROJECT_DIR/$SERVICE_NAME/target/*.jar"
    expire_in: 1 week

# Common Kaniko Docker build job template
.kaniko_template:
  stage: docker
  image:
    name: gcr.io/kaniko-project/executor:debug
    entrypoint: [""]
  script:
    - echo "Building Docker image for $SERVICE_NAME with Kaniko"
    - |
      /kaniko/executor
      --context $CI_PROJECT_DIR/$SERVICE_NAME
      --dockerfile $CI_PROJECT_DIR/$SERVICE_NAME/Dockerfile
      --destination "$CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE/$SERVICE_NAME:$CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG"
  only:
    - main

# Trigger for Microservice A with SERVICE_NAME set to "microservice-a"
trigger_microservice_a:
  stage: build_microservices
  trigger:
    include: 'microservice-a/.gitlab-ci-child.yml'
    strategy: depend
  rules:
    - changes:
        - microservice-a/**/*
  variables:
    SERVICE_NAME: "microservice-a"

# Trigger for Microservice B with SERVICE_NAME set to "microservice-b"
trigger_microservice_b:
  stage: build_microservices
  trigger:
    include: 'microservice-b/.gitlab-ci-child.yml'
    strategy: depend
  rules:
    - changes:
        - microservice-b/**/*
  variables:
    SERVICE_NAME: "microservice-b"
```

In this setup:
- `.maven_template` is the common Maven build job template.
- `.kaniko_template` is the common Docker build job template using Kaniko.
- The `SERVICE_NAME` variable is passed to both jobs, which controls which microservice is being built.

### 2. **Child Pipelines (`microservice-a/.gitlab-ci-child.yml` and `microservice-b/.gitlab-ci-child.yml`)**

The child pipelines can reuse the same common templates by passing the appropriate `SERVICE_NAME` from the parent pipeline. No need to duplicate the jobs for each microservice; you just extend the common templates and inherit the `SERVICE_NAME`.

#### **Child Pipeline for Microservice A (`microservice-a/.gitlab-ci-child.yml`)**

```yaml
stages:
  - build
  - docker

# Use the common Maven template and reference the SERVICE_NAME
maven_build:
  extends: .maven_template
  script:
    - echo "Building $SERVICE_NAME with Maven"
    - mvn clean install -DskipTests

# Use the common Kaniko template and reference the SERVICE_NAME
docker_build:
  extends: .kaniko_template
  script:
    - echo "Building Docker image for $SERVICE_NAME"
    - |
      /kaniko/executor
      --context $CI_PROJECT_DIR/$SERVICE_NAME
      --dockerfile $CI_PROJECT_DIR/$SERVICE_NAME/Dockerfile
      --destination "$CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE/$SERVICE_NAME:$CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG"
```

#### **Child Pipeline for Microservice B (`microservice-b/.gitlab-ci-child.yml`)**

```yaml
stages:
  - build
  - docker

# Use the common Maven template and reference the SERVICE_NAME
maven_build:
  extends: .maven_template
  script:
    - echo "Building $SERVICE_NAME with Maven"
    - mvn clean install -DskipTests

# Use the common Kaniko template and reference the SERVICE_NAME
docker_build:
  extends: .kaniko_template
  script:
    - echo "Building Docker image for $SERVICE_NAME"
    - |
      /kaniko/executor
      --context $CI_PROJECT_DIR/$SERVICE_NAME
      --dockerfile $CI_PROJECT_DIR/$SERVICE_NAME/Dockerfile
      --destination "$CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE/$SERVICE_NAME:$CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG"
```

### 3. **How It Works:**

- **Parent Pipeline**: 
    - The parent pipeline triggers child pipelines and passes `SERVICE_NAME` as an environment variable, indicating which microservice is being built.
  
- **Common Job Templates**: 
    - The `.maven_template` and `.kaniko_template` jobs are reusable across all microservices.
    - These jobs use the `SERVICE_NAME` variable to customize their behavior (e.g., specifying the correct directory and Dockerfile).

- **Child Pipelines**:
    - The child pipelines simply extend the common templates from the parent and make use of the passed `SERVICE_NAME` to correctly build and deploy the specific microservice.

### 4. **Advantages:**

1. **DRY Principle**: 
   - No duplicated code across different microservice pipelines. All the common logic for Maven and Docker builds is centralized in the parent pipeline.
   
2. **Dynamic Behavior**: 
   - You only need to pass `SERVICE_NAME` to adjust the behavior for each microservice, which simplifies pipeline configuration.

3. **Scalability**:
   - Adding new microservices to this setup is very simple. You only need to pass a new `SERVICE_NAME` in the parent pipeline and the same templates can be reused.

4. **Clean Structure**: 
   - The actual logic (e.g., Maven build, Docker build with Kaniko) is written once and reused, making the pipeline easier to maintain.

### **Conclusion:**
By using a combination of **common job templates** and **environment variables**, you can significantly simplify your GitLab CI/CD pipeline. The `SERVICE_NAME` variable allows you to handle different microservices dynamically without duplicating job definitions. This setup is clean, scalable, and maintainable.
