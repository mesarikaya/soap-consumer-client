If you're using Bitnami's Redis Cluster Helm chart with ArgoCD and encountering this issue, here's a tailored approach to fix it:


---

1. Understand the Default Behavior of Bitnami Redis Cluster

By default, the Bitnami Redis Helm chart:

Restricts connections to the Redis pods to internal Kubernetes networking.

Enables authentication with a password.

Uses headless services and StatefulSets for cluster deployment.


The potential attack message happens because the Redis configuration doesn't recognize the external localhost (from port-forwarding) as a valid cluster member.



---

2. Fixing Connection Issue

To connect via kubectl port-forward, you need to modify some Redis configuration settings:

Update Helm Chart Values

You can override the default Helm chart values using a values.yaml file when deploying with ArgoCD. Add the following updates:

auth:
  enabled: true
  password: YOUR_STRONG_PASSWORD

cluster:
  enabled: true
  externalAccess:
    enabled: true
    service:
      type: ClusterIP
      ports:
        redis: 6379

# Allow connections from 0.0.0.0 (localhost for port-forwarded connections)
networkPolicy:
  enabled: false

service:
  annotations: {}
  type: ClusterIP
  ports:
    redis: 6379

Key Changes:

auth.enabled: Ensures Redis authentication is on.

cluster.externalAccess: Configures external access for your cluster.

networkPolicy.enabled: Disables network restrictions temporarily for debugging.

service.type: Keeps it as ClusterIP for internal communication.


Deploy the updated chart using ArgoCD.

3. Port-Forward a Redis Master Node

Once deployed, find a Redis master pod and port-forward it:

kubectl get pods -n YOUR_NAMESPACE -l app.kubernetes.io/component=master

Then, port-forward the master pod:

kubectl port-forward -n YOUR_NAMESPACE POD_NAME 6379:6379


---

4. Connect to Redis Locally

Use the Redis CLI to connect to the forwarded Redis instance:

redis-cli -h 127.0.0.1 -p 6379 -a YOUR_STRONG_PASSWORD

If you're using an application to connect, make sure it includes the password in the connection string.


---

5. Check Redis Logs

If the issue persists, check the logs of the Redis pods to identify the cause:

kubectl logs -n YOUR_NAMESPACE POD_NAME

Look for any connection-related errors or warnings.


---

6. Revert Debug Changes

Once the connection is successful, ensure you tighten the security by re-enabling the network policy:

networkPolicy:
  enabled: true

Apply these changes and redeploy via ArgoCD.
