In MapStruct's @AfterMapping, you cannot change or return the mapped object itself. Instead, @AfterMapping is designed for modifying the already-created DTO rather than replacing or returning a new one.

If you need to modify the DTO after mapping, it must be done in-place via the @MappingTarget annotation. Here’s a breakdown:


---

Why Can't You Return in @AfterMapping?

MapStruct manages the object lifecycle during mapping. The @AfterMapping hook is only a post-processing step that modifies the same instance created during the mapping.

If you need to perform actions that transform the object and return a new instance, you would need to handle this outside MapStruct or by using a custom method within the mapper.

Updated Approach Using @AfterMapping (No Return)

Here’s how you can use @AfterMapping to make additional changes directly to the DTO:

@Mapper(componentModel = "spring")
public interface MyMapper {
    @Mapping(target = "processedField", ignore = true) // Ignore processed field
    MyDTO toDTO(MyEntity entity);

    @AfterMapping
    default void processAfterMapping(@MappingTarget MyDTO dto, @Context MyService myService) {
        // Modify the DTO directly
        myService.performAction(dto);
    }
}

This approach ensures that:

The dto is updated in-place.

The performAction method in your service modifies the fields as needed.

Alternative: Custom Mapping Method

If you must return a modified object (e.g., replacing the original DTO), you can define a custom method in the mapper interface instead of relying on @AfterMapping.

@Mapper(componentModel = "spring")
public interface MyMapper {

    @Mapping(target = "processedField", ignore = true) // Ignore processed field
    MyDTO mapToDTO(MyEntity entity);

    // Custom method that combines mapping and processing
    default MyDTO mapAndProcess(MyEntity entity, MyService myService) {
        MyDTO dto = mapToDTO(entity); // Standard mapping
        myService.performAction(dto); // Modify the DTO via the service
        return dto; // Return the modified DTO
    }
}

Usage:

@Service
public class MyApplicationService {

    private final MyMapper myMapper;
    private final MyService myService;

    public MyApplicationService(MyMapper myMapper, MyService myService) {
        this.myMapper = myMapper;
        this.myService = myService;
    }

    public void processEntity(MyEntity entity) {
        MyDTO dto = myMapper.mapAndProcess(entity, myService);
        System.out.println(dto);
    }
}

Choosing the Right Approach:

1. Use @AfterMapping if:

You want to modify the same DTO instance.

You don’t need to replace or return a new DTO.



2. Use a Custom Method if:

You need to return a completely transformed DTO.

You want the flexibility to orchestrate mapping and processing together.
