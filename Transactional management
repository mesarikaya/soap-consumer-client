This is a common pattern where you have a sequence of operations involving database persistence, message sending via RabbitMQ, and then waiting for a response from another service before returning the result to the client.

Given your setup, where you're facing issues related to "mandatory transactions," let me walk you through the steps and potential pitfalls:

### 1. **Transactional Boundaries**
   - When you save an entity to the database, it’s essential that this operation is wrapped in a transaction to ensure atomicity.
   - Typically, this method would be annotated with `@Transactional`.

   Example:
   ```java
   @Transactional
   public YourEntity saveEntity(YourEntity entity) {
       return yourRepository.save(entity);
   }
   ```

### 2. **Sending a Message After Saving**
   - After saving the entity, you send a message to another service via RabbitMQ. This step should happen **after** the transaction commits, ensuring the entity is fully persisted before the message is sent.
   - You can achieve this by leveraging Spring's `@TransactionalEventListener` or by using a transaction synchronization mechanism.

   Example using `TransactionSynchronizationManager`:
   ```java
   @Transactional
   public YourEntity saveEntityAndSendMessage(YourEntity entity) {
       YourEntity savedEntity = yourRepository.save(entity);
       
       // Register synchronization to send the message after transaction commit
       TransactionSynchronizationManager.registerSynchronization(new TransactionSynchronizationAdapter() {
           @Override
           public void afterCommit() {
               sendMessageToRabbitMQ(savedEntity);
           }
       });
       
       return savedEntity;
   }
   ```

   Example using `@TransactionalEventListener`:
   ```java
   @Transactional
   public YourEntity saveEntity(YourEntity entity) {
       YourEntity savedEntity = yourRepository.save(entity);
       applicationEventPublisher.publishEvent(new EntitySavedEvent(savedEntity));
       return savedEntity;
   }

   @TransactionalEventListener(phase = TransactionPhase.AFTER_COMMIT)
   public void handleEntitySavedEvent(EntitySavedEvent event) {
       sendMessageToRabbitMQ(event.getEntity());
   }
   ```

### 3. **Handling Callback from RabbitMQ**
   - After sending the message, the other service processes it and sends a response back via RabbitMQ. Your application then consumes this response.
   - Ensure that this consumption process is independent of the initial transaction to avoid blocking the transaction lifecycle.

   Here’s an outline of how to structure this:

   - **Message Sender**: Sends a message after the entity is saved (post-commit).
   - **Message Consumer**: Listens to a RabbitMQ queue for the response and then processes it.
   - **Controller**: If you want to return the response synchronously, you can use a mechanism like `CompletableFuture` or `CountDownLatch` to wait for the response before returning.

### 4. **Controller and Waiting for the Response**
   - The controller method might look something like this:

   ```java
   @Autowired
   private MessageService messageService;

   @Autowired
   private YourService yourService;

   @PostMapping("/process")
   public ResponseEntity<String> processRequest(@RequestBody YourRequest request) throws InterruptedException, ExecutionException {
       YourEntity entity = yourService.saveEntity(request.toEntity());
       CompletableFuture<String> futureResponse = messageService.sendAndReceiveMessage(entity);
       
       // Blocking until the response is received
       String response = futureResponse.get();  // Or apply timeout handling as needed

       return ResponseEntity.ok(response);
   }
   ```

   The `MessageService` class would be responsible for sending the message and waiting for the response:
   ```java
   @Service
   public class MessageService {

       @Autowired
       private RabbitTemplate rabbitTemplate;

       private final ConcurrentMap<String, CompletableFuture<String>> pendingRequests = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();

       public CompletableFuture<String> sendAndReceiveMessage(YourEntity entity) {
           CompletableFuture<String> futureResponse = new CompletableFuture<>();
           String correlationId = UUID.randomUUID().toString();

           // Store the future with the correlationId
           pendingRequests.put(correlationId, futureResponse);

           // Send the message with the correlationId
           Message message = createMessage(entity, correlationId);
           rabbitTemplate.convertAndSend("exchange", "routingKey", message);

           return futureResponse;
       }

       @RabbitListener(queues = "yourQueue")
       public void handleResponse(Message responseMessage) {
           String correlationId = extractCorrelationId(responseMessage);
           CompletableFuture<String> futureResponse = pendingRequests.remove(correlationId);

           if (futureResponse != null) {
               futureResponse.complete(extractPayload(responseMessage));
           }
       }
   }
   ```

### 5. **Common Issues**
   - **Transaction Not Committed**: If your RabbitMQ message is sent before the transaction commits, the entity might not be saved, leading to inconsistency. Ensure the message is sent after the transaction commits.
   - **Blocking Transactions**: Ensure your message handling logic does not block the transaction lifecycle or run within a transactional context unless necessary.
   - **Timeouts**: Consider adding timeout handling in your controller if waiting for the RabbitMQ response can take time.

### 6. **Logging and Debugging**
   - Use logging extensively to ensure that your transaction boundaries and message flows are correctly aligned.
   - Make sure to test the transaction scenarios thoroughly, especially in distributed environments.

By following these guidelines, you should be able to handle the transaction management issue effectively and ensure that your database operations, RabbitMQ messaging, and callbacks work together smoothly.
