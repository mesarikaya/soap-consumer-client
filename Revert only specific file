If the file you accidentally added was committed along with several other files (which you want to keep), and you only want to remove or revert changes to that one file, you can follow these steps:

### Steps to Revert Only the Accidental File:

1. **Checkout the Previous Version of the File**:
   First, check out the version of the file from the commit just before you added it:

   ```bash
   git checkout <commit-hash>^ -- <file-path>
   ```

   Replace `<commit-hash>` with the hash of the commit where the file was accidentally added, and `<file-path>` with the path to that specific file. This command reverts the file in your working directory to its state before the accidental commit.

2. **Stage the Reverted File**:
   Now, stage only the reverted file:

   ```bash
   git add <file-path>
   ```

3. **Create a New Commit**:
   Commit the change:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Revert accidental addition of <file-path>"
   ```

4. **Push the Changes**:
   If youâ€™re working on a remote branch, push your changes:

   ```bash
   git push origin <branch-name>
   ```

### Key Points:
- This process only affects the specified file and keeps the rest of your project and history intact.
- The file will be restored to its state before the accidental commit, while all other files in the same commit will remain as they are.

By following these steps, you ensure that only the unintended file changes are reverted, without affecting the other correct files in that commit.
